Options Trading Strategy Evaluation Framework

Stage: Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

Problem Statement

Options traders frequently design strategies (e.g., covered calls, straddles, spreads) based on forecasts of volatility and directional market views. However, many strategies that appear profitable in backtests fail under real-world trading conditions due to transaction costs, liquidity, or regime shifts. The problem is to evaluate whether a given options trading strategy is robust and implementable under realistic market constraints.

This matters because poorly framed strategies can lead to persistent losses, excessive margin usage, or regulatory capital inefficiency. A systematic framework to evaluate strategies will help portfolio managers and traders make better-informed decisions, reducing risks of overfitting and improving capital allocation.

Stakeholder & User

Stakeholder (decision owner): Portfolio Manager (decides which strategies to allocate capital to).
Users (operators): Quantitative Analyst (develops/evaluates strategies) and Trader (executes them).
Decision window: Monthly (strategy review and capital allocation).

Useful Answer & Decision

Answer type: Predictive (expected returns, risks, and probability of strategy breakdown).
Form of artifact: Strategy performance report with backtest results, forward-looking stress scenarios, and risk bands.
Decision trigger: PM decides whether to allocate capital to a strategy for the upcoming month.

Assumptions & Constraints

Market liquidity sufficient for entry/exit.
Stationarity of implied vs. realized volatility relationships over short horizons.
Transaction costs and margin requirements modeled conservatively.
Runtime constraint: must generate results in <30 minutes per strategy.
Compliance: strategy must meet risk and leverage guidelines.

Known Unknowns / Risks

Regime shifts (volatility spikes, structural changes).
Data limitations (missing options chains, survivorship bias).
Model risk from backtest overfitting.
Monitoring plan: flag unstable assumptions (e.g., sudden jump in bid-ask spreads, skew shifts).

Lifecycle Mapping

Goal: Evaluate options strategy robustness → Stage: Problem Framing (Stage 01) → Deliverable: Scoping note + repo skeleton.
Goal: Generate predictive backtests & stress scenarios → Stage: Modeling → Deliverable: backtest notebooks + simulation code.
Goal: Provide actionable strategy reports → Stage: Delivery → Deliverable: monthly summary report/dashboard.

Repo Plan
