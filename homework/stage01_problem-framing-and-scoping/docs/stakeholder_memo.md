We propose developing a systematic evaluation framework for options trading strategies, with emphasis on robustness under real-world constraints. For each candidate strategy, the tool will provide:
Predictive performance estimates (expected returns, risk ranges).
Stress scenarios to account for volatility spikes and liquidity shocks.
Implementation checks (transaction costs, margin usage).
This will enable you to decide, on a monthly cycle, whether to allocate or withdraw capital from a strategy. We assume stable volatility relationships and liquid options chains but will monitor for risks such as regime shifts and data gaps. Deliverables will be staged to provide incremental validation and allow early feedback.
